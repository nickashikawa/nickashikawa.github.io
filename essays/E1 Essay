When I first started Browser History 1 I was very lost so I decided to follow along with the screencast first just so that I will have a good understanding before I begin. Once I finished I deleted the code and restarted and I would do it until I got stuck and I really couldn't figure out how to move one and go back to the screencast. I repeated this until I was able to complete the assignment without watching the screencast. Also during this time I decided not to time myself because I knew that I was not fully confident in myself to complete it without watching the screencast. For the first one it took me three tries until I was able to confidently do it and the final time was 15 minutes and 44 seconds. Then for the next two I decided to just watch the screencast first because after reading the instructions I couldn't understand what I had to do. So after watching I understood better what I had to and it was a lot easier rather than trying to follow along first then going back and forth with coding and watching the screencast. When I could sit and watch it closely to make sure that I fully understand the tasks that I need to complete. For the second WOD it took me 2 tries and 14 minutes and 31 seconds then the third WOD took me 3 tries and 15 minutes and 23 seconds. My advice for this would be if you can't understand the instructions given in the beginning to sit and watch the screenscast without trying to follow a long and code so that you will fully understand what you need to do once you try without watching the video.
