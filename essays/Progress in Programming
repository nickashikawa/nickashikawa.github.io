My programming skills have greatly improved.
I am enthusiastic about programming.
I can do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.
The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).
I think the class can be improved to help my learning.
There are things that work really well my learning in this class.

I agree that my programming skills have greatly improved, prior to taking this course I had little to no experience in programming. I definitely feel that I understand the concept of it after completing Assignment 1. At the beginning of the course, it was difficult for me to fully grasp what each function did through Assignment 1 which we were forced to understand how the functions work in order to move on. I agree that I am enthusiastic about programming because while working through challenges during the course I always thought to myself that I donâ€™t feel like quitting which was a sign to me that I actually do want to learn and get better at programming. Before taking this course, I was very nervous as if I was capable of doing so but after completing the labs and WODs, I have gained the confidence that I am able to understand this.  I disagree that I cannot do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions. I still cannot fully do the WODs no my own yet but to make up for it I keep redoing it until I am to do it without the screencast. 
I agree with the statement that these labs help me learn however I am unable to complete them with confidence. I understand the assignments to an extent as to how much I am able to keep up with it but I know that it is my job to learn what I don't on my own. I disagree that I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming. There are still functions that I don't completely understand but I will put it upon myself to go to office hours and own research to solve my confusion. I disagree that the class can be improved to help my learning since there is so much to go through in the semester. If anything I would say to slow down the  course; however, this course has so many topics to go through meaning that there is a strict schedule to follow and make sure all the topics are covered. I agree that there are things that work really well for my learning in this class. Being able to do the labs together in class really help as I am able to watch how it is completed which helps with my visual learning style.
