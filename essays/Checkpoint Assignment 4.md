Justin, Julia, and I will be building a e-store for the coffee shop merchandise, Morning Brew. We will be completing the front-end of the website and making sure that it is visually appealing and easy to use. We will be adding in a shopping cart and have multiple sub tabs for the different types of products. Make using the credit card information and customer interaction easier to use. Allow both the payment and customer information to be stored and remembered when they come back to buy another product.   

We will be using cookies to be able to allow security for credit card information and allowing autofill. File I/O will be used to create a log in page for customers. Sessions we be used to save the information from previous customers. 

We will be creating a schedule to make sure that we complete the needed requirements. Meeting with Daniel Port/Rick Kaizman consistantly to make sure that we are meeting the needs and wants of the customer. Trying to meet up with at least 2/3 members to work on the code everyday, while also each member creates a css page and decided which one is the best. 

Decided to do the front-end of the e-commerce and created a list of tasks we want to complete and decided on a schedule of when we want to complete such. Our idea for the website is to add a shopping cart, making it visually appealing, and easier to use. We have to create the code for the server and editing the css.
