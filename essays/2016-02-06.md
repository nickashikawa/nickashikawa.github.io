## About Myself

My name is Nickolas Ashikawa and I am currently a junior majoring in marketing, international business, and MIS. I currently work at Ted Baker to fulfill my interest of fashion and learn about the industry. I started doing photography my sophomore year of high school and never stopped since. I don't do it professionally but just for fun, I love being able to create photos when I have inspiration.   

## Why I decided to major in MIS/take ITM 352

I decided to take ITM 352 because I have an interest in MIS and I am unsure of what the major entails and was told by others that I should take this course to see if I want to pursue MIS further or not. Coding/programming is skills that I want to learn and understand i've always had an interest for it but never the resources or tools to learn. The reason why I chose MIS as a major is because through taking Business 310 I learned a lot more about business statistics and data analysist. I was then told that I should add on MIS with marketing since they go together well.
